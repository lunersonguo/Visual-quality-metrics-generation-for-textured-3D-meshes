\section{Conclusion and perspectives}
In this work, we have presented an effective way of generating visual quality metrics for textured 3D meshes. The metrics, which are the optimized combinations based on subjective opinions, perform outstandingly among existing metrics in term of correlation with the HVS judgment.  These metrics can be applied to the evaluation of recent progressive compression algorithms for textured 3D models. The methodology of generating the metrics has been proven to be effective under different rendering settings and open-end as well, which means two elements of the metric ($Q_G$ and $Q_T$) can be substituted by other future measurements of geometric and textural distortions respectively.  \\
Our future works will focus on the inter-relations on mapping the texture onto geometry, which can be used as another element on generating more effective metrics for textured 3D meshes.\textit{}\textbf{}
