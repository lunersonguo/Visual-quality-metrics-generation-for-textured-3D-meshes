\section{Toward an optimal metric for mesh quality assessment}
Since we have obtained all subjective ranks for all the distorted models, appropriately using all these data is critical for evaluating all the existing and newly proposed metrics, and the study of combining geometric and textural metrics optimally. However, the subjective ranks cannot be directly used for these purposes, because ranking is usually regarded as a less accurate method of expressing how far the different distorted models may be to each other.  To solve this problem, we made a preference matrix \cite{Ledda_2005} to convert the all the subjective ranks into votes score. For example, suppose that we have n distorted models (e.g., 5 models) ready to be compared via our comparison protocol.   At each paired comparison, the each subject’s “vote” for the more similar model to the reference is recorded as a value of 1. After all the pairs have been presented, we can record the results in a nXn matrix.
