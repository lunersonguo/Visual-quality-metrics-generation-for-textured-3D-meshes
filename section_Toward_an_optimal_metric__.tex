\section{Toward an optimal metric for mesh quality assessment}
Since we have obtained all subjective ranks for all the distorted models, appropriately using all these data is critical for evaluating all the existing and newly proposed metrics, and the study of combining geometric and textural metrics optimally. However, the subjective ranks cannot be directly used for these purposes, because ranking is usually regarded as a less accurate method of expressing how far the different distorted models may be to each other.
