@article{Sheikh2006,
  abstract = {Measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to numerous image and video processing applications. The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a reference or perfect image in some perceptual space. Such full-reference QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of natural images and videos that are meant for human consumption. Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at the LIVE website.},

@article{Chandler2007,
  abstract = {This paper presents an efficient metric for quantifying the visual fidelity of natural images based on near-threshold and suprathreshold properties of human vision. The proposed metric, the visual signal-to-noise ratio (VSNR), operates via a two-stage approach. In the first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of distortions in the presence of natural images are computed via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual summation in order to determine whether the distortions in the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is deemed to be of perfect visual fidelity (VSNR = infinity) and no further analysis is required. If the distortions are suprathreshold, a second stage is applied which operates based on the low-level visual property of perceived contrast, and the mid-level visual property of global precedence. These two properties are modeled as Euclidean distances in distortion-contrast space of a multiscale wavelet decomposition, and VSNR is computed based on a simple linear sum of these distances. The proposed VSNR metric is generally competitive with current metrics of visual fidelity; it is efficient both in terms of its low computational complexity and in terms of its low memory requirements; and it operates based on physical luminances and visual angle (rather than on digital pixel values and pixel-based dimensions) to accommodate different viewing conditions.},

  abstract = {The properties of the human visual system are taken into account, along with the geometric aspects of an object, in a new surface remeshing algorithm and a new mesh simplification algorithm. Both algorithms have a preprocessing step and are followed by the remeshing or mesh simplification steps. The preprocessing step computes an importance map that indicates the visual masking potential of the visual patterns on the surface. The importance map is then used to guide the remeshing or mesh simplification algorithms. Two different methods are proposed for computing an importance map that indicates the masking potential of the visual patterns on the surface. The first one is based on the Sarnoff visual discrimination metric, and the second one is inspired by the visual masking tool available in the current JPEG2000 standard. Given an importance map, the surface remeshing algorithm automatically distributes few samples to surface regions with strong visual masking properties due to surface texturing, lighting variations, bump mapping, surface reflectance and inter-reflections. Similarly, the mesh simplification algorithm simplifies more aggressively where the light field of an object can hide more geometric artifacts.},

@article{Cheng2007,
  abstract = {Many protocols optimized to transmissions over wireless networks have been proposed. However, one issue that has not been looked into is considering human perception in deciding a transmission strategy for three-dimensional (3D) objects. Several factors, such as the number of vertices and the resolution of texture, can affect the display quality of 3D objects. When the resources of a graphics system are not sufficient to render the ideal image, degradation is inevitable. It is therefore important to study how individual factors affect the overall quality, and how the degradation can be controlled given limited bandwidth resources and possibility of data loss. In this paper, the essential factors determining the display quality are reviewed. We provide an overview of our research on designing a 3D perceptual quality metric integrating two important ones, resolution of texture and resolution of mesh, that control the transmission bandwidth requirements. A review of robust mesh transmission considering packet loss is presented, followed by a discussion of the difference of existing literature with our problem and approach. We then suggest alternative strategies for packet transmission of both 3D texture and mesh. These strategies are then compared with respect to preserving 3D perceptual quality under packet loss},
