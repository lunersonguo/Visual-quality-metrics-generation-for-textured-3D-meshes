\section{Relatd work}
There exist various visual quality metrics on image, mesh and textured 3D mesh, and we summarize a brief survey on these metrics. We firstly provide some visual perception based image metrics. Then several visual geometric metrics, inspired by these image metrics, are presented. Readers can also refer to \cite{Corsini_2013} for the details of these geometric metrics.  Meanwhile, we also supply metrics on textured 3D models. 
\subsection{Image quality metrics}
Most existing 2D image metrics are known as full-reference, meaning that a complete reference image is compared with a processed one.  The most wildly used and simplest metric is the mean squared error (MSE), stem from PSNR. However, it is not well correlated with subjective visual opinion \cite{Snyder_1985} \cite{Teo}. Hence, early researchers \cite{Mannos_1974} made extensive efforts on the development of bottom-up visual quality measurement, simulating the functionality of human visual system (HVS) components. However, the HVS is very complex and non-linear, and thus, it makes the measurements relied on very strong assumptions generalizations \cite{Wang_2004}. In contrast, Pioneers like
