\section{Relatd work}
There exist various visual quality metrics on image, mesh and textured 3D mesh, and we summaries a brief survey on these metrics. We firstly provide some visual perception based image metrics. Then several visual geometric metrics, inspired by these image metrics, are presented. Readers can also refer to \cite{Corsini_2013} for the details of these geometric metrics.  Meanwhile, we also supply metrics on textured 3D models. 
\subsection{Image quality metrics}
Most existing 2D image metrics are known as full-reference, meaning that a complete reference image is compared with a processed image.  The most wildly and simplest metric is the mean squared error (MSE), based on PSNR. However, it is not well correlated with subjective visual opinion \cite{Snyder_1985} \cite{Teo}. Then, researchers \cite{Mannos_1974} made extensive efforts on the development of bottom-up visual quality measurement, simulating the functionality of human visual system (HVS) components. However, the HVS is very complex and non-linear, thus, make the measurements relied on very strong assumptions. In contrast, Pioneers like
