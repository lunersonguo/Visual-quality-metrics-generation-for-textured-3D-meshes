\section{Relatd work}
There exist various visual quality metrics on image, mesh and textured 3D mesh, and we summaries a brief survey on these metrics. We firstly provide some visual perception based image metrics. Then several visual geometric metrics, inspired by these image metrics, are presented. Readers can also refer to \cite{Corsini_2013} for the details of these geometric metrics.  Meanwhile, we also supply metrics on textured 3D models.
