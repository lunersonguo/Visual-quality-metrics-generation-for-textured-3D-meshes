\section{Subjective experiments}
This experiment aims at studying the visual annoyance impacts from mixed textural and geometric artifacts on textured 3D models. In detail, we ask all the participants firstly to observe a reference model briefly, and then, regarding to the reference, select out the more similar model in the following paired comparisons. The outputs of this experiment show the patterns on the HVS sensitivity towards different types of artifacts, and can be also used as an evaluation on the performance of existing metrics.
