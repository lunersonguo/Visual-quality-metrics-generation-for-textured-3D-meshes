\section{Subjective experiments}
This experiment aims at studying the visual annoyance impacts from mixed textural and geometric artifacts on textured 3D models. In detail, we ask all the participants firstly to observe a reference model briefly, and then, regarding to the reference, select out the more similar model in the following paired comparisons. The outputs of this experiment show the patterns on the HVS sensitivity towards different types of artifacts, and can be also used as an evaluation on the performance of existing metrics.
\subsection{Experimental design}
In the design of subjective quality evaluation experiment, we selected the protocol, known as paired comparison \cite{Lee_2011}, over rating methods which usually have problems with validity and reliability \cite{Govindarajulu_1992}. Opposite to the rating methods, for which the subjects usually require necessary trainings before the experiment, paired comparisons have the advantages of more simplicity and subject consistency \cite{Wills_2009}. \\
In the study, each observer was firstly shown a rendered video clip containing illumination and a textured 3D mesh with constant speed rotation. After an observation within15 seconds, a series of paired video clips having the same illumination and animating object, but with varying amount of (geometric and textural) distortions were displayed to the observer, and he/she was asked to select a more similar clip from left side video or right side one, regarding to the reference video(Figure 1 presents a screenshot of the experiment test). \\
For the reference models, we chose five textured triangle meshes from different applied technological fields. The Hulk and the sport car are the artificial models from ShareGC.com, which is a social community of CG Artists, Animators and 3D Modelers displaying and sharing their work. The squirrel and the Easter Island statue, supported by Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory, are scanned real objects mapped with texture extracted from multiple photographs of physical statues. The Dwarf is also an artificial textured mesh created by. (Figuere 2 shows all our models for the experiment)\\
All the models were rendered in Autodesk 3DS Max 2015, commonly used as a professional  3D computer graphics program for making 3D animations, models, games and images. We used two sets of illumination and rendering settings to render the video clips.   Skylight illumination was firstly used to cast on all the models and their distorted ones since the surface properties are clearer under this illumination than under atypical ones such as a single point light source \cite{Fleming_2003}. Then, we utilized a spotlight illumination, set up by , on Dwarf models for validating the feasibility of our combined metrics under different illuminations.  Two low-speed rotating rates by pivoting the vertical axis were applied to the models under two different illuminations respectively, 0.628rad/s and 0.838rad/s, besides participants could optionally control the video play to observe models carefully. The sizes of rendered videos under two illuminations are 1280X1024 and 1920X1080(HDTV). All the experiments were conducted on a 15-inche MacBook Pro.
