Screenshot from the paired comparison experiment. The observer is asked to click on the appropriate radio below two models to show which one looks closer to the original one, then click on the \emph{Sure! Next}, or \emph{Not Sure, Next} button according to his/her selection confidence.  This kind of test mode enjoys several advantages such like the subjectively easier task,  avoidance of  excessive selection time due to the entanglement of subjective determination, etc. Meanwhile, the corresponding judgment confidence is quantitatively recorded (1: \emph{Sure! Next}; 0: \emph{Not Sure, Next}), which can be used in the future study on perceptual distinguishment and  classification toward complex graphic attacks.
