Step 1  All the 20 distorted models are grouped and, in each group, sorted from strength 4 to 1, then two groups (e.g., \textit{Q} group and \textit{J} group) are randomly chosen. From the groups, according to the strength order, models with distortions from strength 4 to 1 are successively shown to the subject for comparison. e.g., in the graph, the subject firstly compares \textit{Q4} and \textit{J4}.  When the subject determines the model closer to the reference (\textit{J4}), the index of the other model (\textit{Q4}) will be pushed into a sorting list (\textit{List1}). Then next 2 models will be shown. In this round, the selected model from previous round (\textit{J4}) and a distorted model with a decreased strength from the other group (\textit{Q3}) are shuffled and displayed to the subject. Then, following this way, repeat the comparisons till all 8 models are sorted from worst visual quality to the best, and their indexes are pushed into \textit{List1}. The comparisons with same way are conducted between other two groups (e.g., \textit{L} group and \textit{Si} group), and another sorting list (\textit{List2}) from these two groups are obtained.
