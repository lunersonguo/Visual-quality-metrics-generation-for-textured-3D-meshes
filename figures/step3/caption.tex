\textbf{Step 3} Choose the long sorting list (\textit{List 3}) and the rest list (\textit{List 1}) as two groups for comparisons. Following the procedure in step 1, the subjects compare all the models from the two groups according to the order shown in the graph till all the 20 models are sorted into the final sorting list (\textit{Final List}), from the worst visual quality to the best, which shows the \textit{Subjective Ranks} of visual quality (1 means the best, and 20 means the worst).
