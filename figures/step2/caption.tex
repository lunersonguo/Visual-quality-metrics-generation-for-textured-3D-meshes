\textbf{Step 2} Randomly choose one sorting list (e.g., \textit{List 2}) as a group, in which all the models are subjectively sorted by their visual qualities, and the rest group (\textit{Su})  for comparisons. Following the procedure in step 1, the subject is supposed to compare the models from the two groups according to the order shown in the graph till all the 12 models are sorted into another sorting list (\textit{List 3}).
